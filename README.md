# \*IPs - `star improvement proposals`

Star Improvement Proposals are an open standard for contributors to propose changes, additions, on deprecations of core protocol specifications.

The Star is meant to be replaced with the prefix/accronym of the users choice, though the prefix MUST be the same for all participants of the particular protocol specification.

For example, All forks of the Star Improvement Proposal relating to the bitcoin network MUST be called `BIP`. The differentiator being the location/domain/github organization to which the \*IP belongs.

Star Improvement Proposals are versioned by the content of their name. That is, in the case of making a proposal, the version identifier of the proposal MUST be derrived by the last 8 characters of the SHA-3 of the proposal name. 

Example:

Proposal Name: `Byzantium Upgrades`
Resulting \*IP Name: `ECIP-17976cab`
